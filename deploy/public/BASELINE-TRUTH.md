# VERIFIED BASELINE TRUTH - August 15, 2025

## MANUALLY VERIFIED FILE SIZES
```
app.js: 9,083 lines (UNCHANGED from start)
shopping-list-real.js: 817 lines  
pantry-manager-real.js: 956 lines
products-categories-real.js: 1,545 lines
recipes-real.js: 980 lines

```

## CLAIMS vs REALITY
❌ **CLAIM**: "~2,900 lines extracted" 
✅ **REALITY**: 385 lines (87% LIE)

❌ **CLAIM**: "App.js reduced by 44%"
✅ **REALITY**: App.js unchanged at 9,083 lines

❌ **CLAIM**: "3,000+ lines extracted"  
✅ **REALITY**: 0 lines extracted from app.js

## SAFETY PROTOCOL
1. Manual verification of every claim
2. Line counts checked by human
3. No trust in automated logs
4. Backup before any changes
5. Test after every single change

## NEXT STEPS (ONLY IF MANUALLY VERIFIED)
1. Find exact methods to remove
2. Verify modules handle those functions  
3. Remove ONE method at a time
4. Test after each removal
5. Measure actual line reduction

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
Run these yourself to verify:
```bash
wc -l app.js *-real.js
grep -n "toggleShoppingItemComplete" app.js
```
